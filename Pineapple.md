# Do you want to know why pineapples are delicious?
Well, I have just the article for you!
## Pineapples ROCK!
Pineapples have a fleshy interior, but a rocky exterior. Their spiky externals make it difficult for animals to try and eat it, allowing it to thrive in places where human intervention is limited, like in tropical areas. Despite this, the juice and flavour of the pineapple is exquisite, having a distinct sharp sweet taste that makes it a great ingredient in drinks and food alike. You can expect pineapples to be there to provide a nice sort of contrast to the whole dish, up-to-and-including pizza.
## "But pineapples on pizza sucks!"
Well actually, you would be mistaken! Contrary to popular belief, Italians are really only apathetic to this fruit, and this idea was only really purveyed by American culture. If you want to blame a party for dejecting pineapple, it should be the Amercians, not the Italians.
